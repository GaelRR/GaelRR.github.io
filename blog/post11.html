        <h1>I Am Not a Designer, Developer, or Writer—But I Made This Anyway</h1>
        <p>03.02.2025</p>
        <br>

        <p>I'm not a <strong>designer</strong>, but I designed this website (and a few other things).</p>
        <p>I'm not a <strong>developer</strong>, but I built this website (and some other projects).</p>
        <p>I'm not a <strong>writer</strong>, but I've written some blog posts and papers.</p>
        <br>

        <p>If you're a <strong>designer</strong>, you might think this website looks rough. You're probably right.</p>
        <p>If you're a <strong>developer</strong>, you might notice this is just basic HTML and CSS. That's fair.</p>
        <p>If you're a <strong>writer</strong>, you might find my writing a bit messy. I won't argue.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>So Why Did I Do It?</h2>
        <p>I don't set out to create <em>bad</em> work—I promise. I just have other things in life that matter more.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 <strong>Family and friends</strong> that I love spending time with.</li>
            <li>💼 <strong>A job</strong> that has nothing to do with designing, coding, or writing.</li>
            <li>🎸 <strong>Hobbies</strong> that take me far away from my laptop.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Making Time to Create</h2>
        <p>My side projects happen in the <strong>tiny gaps</strong> between everything else. Sometimes I wish I had more time to improve my writing, coding, and design skills—but at the end of the day, it's all about priorities.</p>
        <p>For now, my goal is simple: <strong>to create with the limited time I have, even if it's imperfect.</strong></p>
        <br>

        <p>So yeah, my work isn't perfect. But at least it exists. And for now, that's enough.</p>
    
        <p>Hope you enjoy my <em>shitty</em> (but improving) work.</p>
