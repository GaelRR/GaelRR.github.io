        <p class="post-description">This is a short description of the blog post.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the moment, I am writing for myself. Eventually, I might write for an audience. I don’t expect anyone to read this blog post or any of my previous ones. At least not yet.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Writing for Myself</h2>
        <br>    
        <p>I’ve been writing for myself for years but most of what I write I keep private. Rarely, like the posts on this blog, I make public but still do it for myself.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Writing for Myself in Private</h3>
        <br>    
        <p>I write “daily pages” as well as weekly and yearly reviews. My daily pages have both morning and evening “braindumps”. Here I write anything that is in my head. My focus is mostly in thinking, understanding and clearing my thoughts. My daily pages are something that I don’t go back to read, so in the process of writing some of my thoughts might end up becoming plans, todos, goals.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Writing for Myself in Public</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I want to become a better writer and communicator (through text, drawings, photos or whatever other medium necessary to get the message across). I also need to work on failing and putting out work early instead of never launching.</p>
        <br>    
        <p>An example of me writing in public but for myself is this blog post. I don’t intend for it to get published anywhere else, go viral or even be read.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Writing for an Audience</h2>
        <br>    
        <p>My experience in writing for audiences is very limited. I have written many papers both during my bachelors and my masters degrees where the main audience have been professors. I have also written to coworkers, clients, my teams (as a project manager and team lead) and other stakeholders. I have never been someone that shares my words without being asked to do so. I do have LinkedIn, Instagram, X (twitter) and Facebook but rarely share anything.</p>
        <br>    
        <p>Who knows, maybe one day I will write for a large audience but for now, writing for myself is good enough for me.</p>
