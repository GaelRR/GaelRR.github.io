        <p class="post-description">This is a short description of the blog post.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love learning and trying new things. This past few years I’ve been feeling guilty because I feel like I am not learning and experimenting as much as I would like to. One of the things I feel guilty about is not diving deeper into AI but that is my own fault as I decided to prioritise family, my health and my job.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We are all tired of hearing that AI will impact our lives some way or another. We should all either become AI experts or fear to be left behind. At least that is what it feels like.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even though I feel guilty, I was able to get a little bit of learning and experimenting the past few years. I read “Life 3.0 - being human in the age of artificial intelligence” by Max Tegmark when it came out in 2017. I started using Dall-E and ChatGPT as soon as they came out. I got Notion AI before it was released to all user. I later got ChatGPT plus (but canceled it after not feeling like I was getting enough value from it). I have read, watched videos and attended talks on generative AI. I still feel lost.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Text to image generation is one of the areas that I find interesting but haven’t experimented much with. The most popular Text to image generators are probably Dall-E, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. I intend to learn more about them in the near future, both how to use them and how to properly write prompts that will give me the results I want.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For today I think that good enough means just creating an image with Dall-E and StableDiffusion XL. I didn’t really wanted to get into Midjourney… </p>
        <br>
        <p>Here is my terrible but good enough prompt: <br> ”Create a picture of a man that is learning to use generative AI to create pictures so that he can post in a blog post about learning to use generative AI”</p>
        <br>
        <p>And here are the results: </p>
        <br>
        <p>DALL-E </p>

        <br>
        <p>Stable Diffusion </p>
        <img src="/assets/StableDiffusion.png" alt="Stable Diffusion XL">
        <br>
        <p>Good enough.</p>
