        <p class="post-description">This is a short description of the blog post.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Working on becoming a better self is good. 👍 </p>
        <br>
        <p>Working to be perfect, comparing yourself to others and working to be better than everyone else at everything is a potential disaster. 👎 </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have been lucky to meet wonderful mentors and teachers that have given me tips and tools to become a better selv. I have also read many personal development books that have given me knowledge or tools that are still helpful. </p>
        <br>
        <p>About  a decade ago I started building a “manual” for who I am, how I work, what I am working towards and how I am getting there. The amount of tips and tools was getter larger, specially the section about productivity tips and tools. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In my late twenties I had more knowledge and tools to help me be a better self than ever before but I had never felt more lost. I figured that the solution had to be to develop a better “manual”, something I called “My Life Guidebook”. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Some years and versions later, here we are. Some of my closest know about “My Life Guidebook” but most don’t. Now everyone that ends up here will know about it. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What is My Life Guidebook? 🤔</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A manual  and tools for my life. A set of texts and tools that will help me become the best version of my self. My believes, who I am, who I want to become, where I come from, what are my goals and the routines, habits and tools that will help me get there. When feeling lost it should help me get back on track. </p>
        <br>
        <p>My life guidebook is divided into 4 main chapters: </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Chapter 1 - Discovering what is bigger than ourselves 🔭</h3>
        <br>
        <p>What is bigger than myself? The big questions in life, often answered by religion or philosophy. What do I believe in? Where do I find meaning and purpose? </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Chapter 2 - Discovering yourself 🔍</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Who am I and who do I want to become?</p>
        <br>
        <p>My values, vision, mission, rules, personality, bio, current and future roles. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Chapter 3 - Deciding what to do 🎯</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Short- and longterm goals, metrics, objectives and key results</p>
        <br>
        <p>I divide my goals into 5 categories:  ♥️ <strong>Health,</strong> 💙 <strong>Relations,</strong> 💼 <strong>Career,</strong> 💰 <strong>Finances,</strong> 👤 <strong>Personal</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p>Every category has its own: Life long goals, metrics to check how I am doing at any given time, some habits related to it and goals for the current year or quarter. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Chapter 4 - Deciding how to do it ⚙️</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Principles, routines, habits & tools. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Some of the tools: My life guidebook, Journal database with templates for all different types of entries (Daily pages, weekly pages, Yearly review, 5 year plan,..), Habit tracker and more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sometimes I wonder if “My Life Guidebook” does more harm than good. The same is true for every framework both at a personal and organizational level. Time will tell…</p>
        <br>
        <p>In later posts I will introduce some of the chapters and what they look like for me. But for now good enough. ✌️</p>
