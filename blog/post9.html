        <p class="post-description">This is a short description of the blog post.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the process of working to be a better self we will have times where we might be too hard on ourselves. At least that is true for me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started the “Good Enough Blog” about a week ago. I’ve been wanting to share my words for many years but my need for perfection and fear of failing kept me from even starting. A week ago I started sharing my words on this blog with the only goal of sharing everyday and doing it for myself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yesterday I failed. I forgot to share my words and didn’t even realize it until this morning. I got busy with life. My first reaction was shame for forgetting and the need to make up for not posting yesterday. Right away I thought that I needed to write double today. One post for yesterday and one for today.</p>
        <br>    
        <p>Yesterday was a decent day. I spent time with my family and worked out with a friend in the afternoon. If I didn’t think about writing, it was because I was being present, which is a good thing. I think that good enough in this case is admitting that yesterday was a good day, I forgot to write and that is okay, I will write today but not to make up for yesterday.</p>
        <br>    
        <p>One important thing I should mention is that I don’t have any blog posts writing in advance. I write them right before I upload them to my site. I also don’t have a CMS (like for example Wordpress) so the process of uploading a new post requires me to:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Write the blog post in plain text</li>
            <li>Create a new html page and convert my post to html so that it looks good on my site</li>
            <li>Edit the blog page to include the new blog post</li>
            <li>Push the changes to my repository so that it is available for everyone that visit my site</li>
        </ol>
        <br>   
        <p>It is not a very complicated process but it requires a little more than just writing a text and pushing “publish”.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I thought that my next post was going to be about one of the chapters in “My Life Guidebook”. Instead here is a reminder of not being too hard on yourself. I know I need that reminder. As for today, this is good enough.</p>
